TCP Statistical Ping is a simple utility with traditional ping functionalities that are
enriched with additional statistical information like:
- number of packets per second that were successfully sent from host A to host B and back. The size of packets and packet generation rate can be configured.
- average round trip times, host A to host B and host B to host A times calculated every second.
